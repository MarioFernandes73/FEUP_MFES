# FEUP_MFES
Repository for the course "Métodos Formais em Engenharia de Software" (EIC0039) of the first semester of the fourth year of MIEIC in FEUP.

In this repository there is the practical assignment of this course of the lective year of 2017/2018

The aim of this course was to teach students how to specify a software system on a declarative basis, how to distinguish between the various existing formal methods, how to apply them and understand the utility of these techniques in order to improve the quality of the produced software systems.

The project was made using VDM++ and its context was an implementation of a StackOverflow-like application which included:
* Registration
* Login
* Different types of accounts
* Posts (questions) created by registered users
* Answers/ratings created by registered users
* Administration functions
* Search/Order of existing posts

The implementation of the project had 2 phases: creation of the VDM++ model and the integration with a created interface.

The first phase was made using the tool Overture which enabled the user to write VDM++ code as well as performing several functions such as executing/debugging the code, perform different kind of test functions, generating UML diagram, information on LaTeX and Java code.

The second phase was made using the existing generated Java code and implementing a Java Swing interface so that a user could use the previously made and tested functions of the VDM++ model.
